# Object-size-detector
A matlab program to calculate the dimensions of objects in an image

## Pre-requisites
Matlab with:
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox

## Working
Needs to be calibrated using an object of known size after which the dimensions of regular objects can be measured as long as camera-object distance is maintained relatively constant
